1. A nonimpared user may have trouble with their browser and switch to, say Internet Explorer to try that
instead. Ideally, your website would work on Internet Explorer and they could investigate.

2. The timer served only to add frustration. The "placeholders" were actually text that the user had to delete, wasting
time and making it more frustrating. The choice of "yes" and "cancel" for "Are you sure you want to cancel" was
 confusing. I would remove the timer, replace the text with placeholders, and maybe say "don't cancel" and
 "yes, cancel"

3. Lighthouse's main recommendation was to improve the initial loading time of the page.
Originally, I was immediately loading stars data. Now, this large amount of data is only loaded and processed once the
user decides to perform a search.

In addition, I added a language tag to improve accessibility.

With these two changes, I got a perfect lighthouse score on everything other than SEO.

My website was already mobile accessible before I ran Lighthouse.
