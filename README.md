**Project Idea(s):** 
### Idea 1
_Interest Connection App_ <br/>
A platform on which people can connect with strangers with similar interests and hobbies. 
As a result of this pandemic, it has been hard to build meaningful connections with others. 
Bridging the gap between Facebook(virtual connections) and Omegle (meeting strangers) to 
build lasting relationships. Similar to datamatch, where each person contains attributes/interests 
where we can create edges between the people. Use the tree to find nearest neighbors/page rank. 
Create a mathematical formula to make sure that people are accurately matched with others. <br/>
Extra addons:<br/>
• Match people with others that want to teach them things<br/>
• Create study rooms for classes in which people have in common<br/>
• Have a video feed where you keep on swiping and talking to others<br/>
• Create a robust video chat feature<br/>
• Have a venter/listener feature<br/>
• Map number of connections you have with others<br/>

**HTA Approval (dpark20):** Idea approved - make sure your algorithm is complex!

### Idea 2 <br/>
_Schedule Concentration Planner_ <br/>
A website where students can log their classes and concentrations in, and they can see the 
overall difficulty of their semester, the classes they still need to take to meet their 
concentration, and which classes satisfy which requirements. They can also search up and add 
classes to their course load, seeing how different ones would impact their semester.
<br/>
We would need to parse information from Critical Review, looking at time required, difficulty, 
and overall rating on the course and on professors.

**HTA Approval (dpark20):** Idea not approved - not enough algorithmic complexity as of now. Feel free to add more details if you'd like to do this idea.

### Idea 3
_Marketplace App_ <br/>
Students can sign up and create an account to buy and sell items. A buyer can click on either
an “interested” button or “buy now” button. The seller will get a notification and they can 
message each other about how they will deal with their exchange. When both parties agree on a 
trade, both students can retrieve each other's information (which they can decide to show or not)
such as their name, email, dorm, mailing address, etc. Sellers are required to upload pictures 
of their items. In addition, the seller will have to specify how they want their payment to 
be made (i.e. cash, venmo, paypal, etc.) <br/>
When a buyer clicks on “interested” they item will be put on hold for a certain amount of 
time (probably a day) where they can talk about the item with the seller. Once the exchange 
is done, both the seller and buyer will be asked about their experience.

**HTA Approval (dpark20):** Idea not approved for same reason as above.

Good ideas - make sure to add more if you'd like to pursue Ideas 2 or 3. Good luck! :)

**Mentor TA:** _Put your mentor TA's name and email here once you're assigned one!_

## Meetings
